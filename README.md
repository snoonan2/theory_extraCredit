# theory_extraCredit

My extra credit work was a python program that given a user big O input expression would output the corresponding little o expressions to the big O. The available expressions to enter to the program range from logaritmic variations of expressions to exponential and beyond. I wanted to do an extra credit project on the Big O and little o topic becuase I found it conceptually confusing and struggled to understand the true or false questions on the latest Homework 10. I have grown to be grounded in the knowledge that the Big O is the an upper bound that can be tight while the little o represents the smaller growth to the given expression. There are two files in the repository: the code file (bigOtolittle.py) and a screenshot of the terminal that the user would see as an output of the program (terminal.png). I feel that my programming knowledge was challeged as well as a growth in my functions Big O, little o understanding.
